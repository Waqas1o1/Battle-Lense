# ⚔️🌍⚔️ BattleLense – Conflict Prediction System

An **AI-driven multi-agent system** that predicts the possible outcome of a hypothetical conflict between two countries.  
It leverages **LLMs (OpenAI GPT + Google Gemini)**, **Tavily Search API**, and a custom **orchestration framework** to gather military, economic, and sentiment data, analyze contradictions, and provide a well-reasoned prediction report with citations.
